## Getting started

Python 3 is required. After downloading or cloning the repository, navigate to the root directory and run the following commands:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python -m main`

You can also run tests by running each test as a module. For example, run `python -m tests.main` to run the main tests file.
